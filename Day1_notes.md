# Day 1 – Python Basics

## What I Learned
- Python variables do not need type declaration
- Indentation is important
- Lists and dictionaries are very useful
- Dictionaries are similar to JSON
- Functions use def and return
- f-strings are clean and readable

## What Felt Easy
- Variables
- Functions
- Loops (similar to PHP)

## What Felt Different
- Indentation instead of {}
- No semicolons
- Dictionary syntax

## Key Realizations
- Python is cleaner than PHP
- Dictionaries will be important for APIs and AI
- Environment setup is not scary anymore
